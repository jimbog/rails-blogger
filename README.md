Building the Application
==

To start building our application we go to the terminal and issue the
following command

```console
rails new blogger -T
```

By entering this command Rails will generate a new application, setting
up folders and files inside a folder under the 'blogger' name.

Rails also installs dependencies by running bundler. This proccess may
take a few minutes. Once it has finished, change to the directory that
rails has created for us by entering:

```console
cd blogger
```
If you type the ```ls -1pa``` you can see all the files that have been
created.

```console
./
../
.gitignore
.ruby-gemset
.ruby-version
Gemfile
Gemfile.lock
README.rdoc
Rakefile
app/
bin/
config/
config.ru
db/
lib/
log/
public/
test/
tmp/
vendor/
````

This is the standard structure of a new Rails application. Once you
learn this structure it makes working with Rails easier since everything
is in a standard place. Next we'll run this fresh application to check
that our Rails install is working properly. Type:

```console
rails server
```

Open your web-brower and head to: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should
see a 'welcome aboard page'

Now that you've created the Rails application you should open this
folder using Sublime or your favorite text editor.

Now let's create a git repository to be able to track the changes we
make to our code.

```console
git init
```

And let's add all of our files to be tracked

```console
git add -A
```

And create a commit

```console
git commit -m "initial commit"
```

Creating basic functionality
==

Now we're ready to get started building an actual blog. In your command
prompt press ```Ctrl-c to stop the Rails server, or open a new command
prompt and navigate to your Rails application folder. Then you can use a

Rails generator to build some code for you:

```console
rails g scaffold Post title body:text
```

Rails will generate files and folders

```console
      invoke  active_record
      create    db/migrate/20140712034707_create_posts.rb
      create    app/models/post.rb
      invoke  resource_route
       route    resources :posts
      invoke  scaffold_controller
      create    app/controllers/posts_controller.rb
      invoke    erb
      create      app/views/posts
      create      app/views/posts/index.html.erb
      create      app/views/posts/edit.html.erb
      create      app/views/posts/show.html.erb
      create      app/views/posts/new.html.erb
      create      app/views/posts/_form.html.erb
      invoke    helper
      create      app/helpers/posts_helper.rb
      invoke    jbuilder
      create      app/views/posts/index.json.jbuilder
      create      app/views/posts/show.json.jbuilder
      invoke  assets
      invoke    coffee
      create      app/assets/javascripts/posts.js.coffee
      invoke    scss
      create      app/assets/stylesheets/posts.css.scss
      invoke  scss
      create    app/assets/stylesheets/scaffolds.css.scss
```
An important file that was generated was the migration file:

```console
db/migrate/20140712034707_create_posts.rb
```

You've probably noticed that you have a different set of numbers in yours. This is because the name is corresponds to a timestamp (the time when the file was created).

This file looks like this:

```ruby
class CreatePosts < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :posts do |t| 
      t.string :title
      t.string :picture
      t.text :body

      t.timestamps
    end 
  end 
end
```

This file is some Ruby code that is a database agnostic way to manage
your schema. You can see that this code is to create a table called ```Posts and to create two columns in this table, a title column, a picture column and a body column. Finally we need to instruct Rails to apply this to our database.

Type:

```console
rake db:migrate
```

Once this command has run you can start up your Rails server again with rails server and then navigate to [http://localhost:3000/posts](http://localhost:3000/posts) to see the changes you've made to your application.

From here you can play around with your application. Go ahead and create a new blog post.

Let's add the changes we've introduced so far to our git repository


```console
git add -A
git commit -m "add scaffold of Posts and executed the first migration"
```
